# FACE-LIVENESS-MODEL_FOR-LEAVES
This project explores biometric authentication via facial recognition, addressing spoofing vulnerabilities. We introduce a robust face liveness detection system using CNNs, trained on NUAA Imposter and CASIA-FASD datasets, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing real from fake faces, enhancing security in outpass management systems.

STEPS TO USE THIS MODEL 

 1.I am giving a python file which is liveness.py  where you can change the path of the model .
 2. The trained model is in the model folder you can keep that path
 3. After you can run it.
 4. It will take some time finally you can see it camere frame
 5.Result It will detect fake or reak faces 

 Extension:I extended this technology for the leavemanagement system.It has to develop more.

 app.py is the leavemanagement system web when you run it you can get the local host it will connect to your browser.

 Note: set your path and known images folder path correctly
