# FACE-LIVENESS-MODEL_FOR-LEAVES
This project explores biometric authentication via facial recognition, addressing spoofing vulnerabilities. We introduce a robust face liveness detection system using CNNs, trained on NUAA Imposter and CASIA-FASD datasets, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing real from fake faces, enhancing security in outpass management systems.
